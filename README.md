## Features

### User Login
Product users are able to authenticate themselves to the system by providing their system username and password. If a user does not have an account, they can create one. Access control is enforced by account.

### User View
Users can view existing logs optionally filtered and ordered as they choose. The order defaults to most recent. The filter defaults to none. Users are provided a summarized view of all posts, and when selected the post view expands to show the post in full detail.

### Post Creation
Users can create a post to represent an incident that is desired to be communicated to other users. Time and date values for the post are unchangeable to maintain post log integrity. The user can create a title and description for their post. Before submitting, a post can be assigned short description "tags" to be better organized with existing posts.

### Template Creation
Users can create a template of a post to save time when making future posts. Post attributes including current title, description, and tags are saved to the template whent he post template is made. 

### Post Searching
Search capabilities allow the database of posts to be filtered by inclusion or exclusion of keywords in the title and description, post tags, and dates.
